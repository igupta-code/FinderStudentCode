In the case of collisions, we would linear search through the objects that shared a hash function. |
| Oct 29 |  4:45-5:15pm  | I considered what we talked about in class a bit: we want to divide by some number p so that our hash map is not massive. This means a slightly smaller value of p. But we also don't want p so small that the linear search takes too long. I feel like a good mid-ground is where each row in the table has around 5-10 collisions. |

Some poeple in class were creating objects to store into the map, but that didn't seem super elegant. I couldn't really come up with a better approach than that though. |
| Nov 4  |   8:45-9:30   |                                                                                                    I created my hashMap class, layed out the basic structure(ie variables and function headers). I filled out some functions but am having trouble with the contructor / fitting it in with how I am reading in data from the files.  |
