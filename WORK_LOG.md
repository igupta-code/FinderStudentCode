In the case of collisions, we would linear search through the objects that shared a hash function. |
| Oct 29 | 4:45-5:15pm  | I considered what we talked about in class a bit: we want to divide by some number p so that our hash map is not massive. This means a slightly smaller value of p. But we also don't want p so small that the linear search takes too long. I feel like a good mid-ground is where each row in the table has around 5-10 collisions. |
